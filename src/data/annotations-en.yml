  content:
    - "Dorota is an established name on the Slovak music scene. Her latest viral song, Slovenská ľudová tieseň, as well as other great songs such as Tabak, Bratislava, Havran, Kathmandu, and Viem, will blow you away. She plays captivating music on the piano with powerful lyrics that will shout right in your face. Her music is enchantingly elusive. It is retro-pop, heavy-chanson, and poetic-punk. Dorota's smoky jazz voice and compelling, urgent singing provide an exceptional experience. Enriched by the launch of a new EP called Lazy, especially at AMPLIFIER!"
    - "<i>Dorota is not only a singer, she is also a songwriter, author, pianist, composer, and lyricist. She is accompanied by the excellent Marián Slávka and Filip Hittrich (both from the band Talent Transport) and, most recently, guitarist and vocalist Giorgio Turcani. Together, they form a powerful ensemble that captivates audiences in a breathtaking way. Be there!</i>"
