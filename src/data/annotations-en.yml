      "We live in the age of means. They are everywhere: means of transport, communication, information. We are completely surrounded by our own creations. We spend most of our time inside buildings. And the ceiling isn&#39;t really the heavens. The light is not the sun. And the air conditioning is not the wind. Furthermore, we spend about half of the time we are awake in front of computer screens, mobile phones or TVs. We miss nature: the water, the forests, the clouds, the wind. We also miss the silent universe hidden inside us: in the noise of the media and the daily rush of work, we often fail to hear the subtle signals of our bodies. We need to get closer to ourselves again. But how to do it? Jan Markoš&#39;s book and the discussion will try to answer this question."

At the end of the day, Ilya comes to to his old apartment in Druzhkivka, where he once lived with his family, to spend the night.

      "<i><b>Tomáš a Markéta</b> is a promising musical ensemble that has been overlooked by
professionals and the general public for several decades. Nevertheless, with unceasing
enthusiasm, they devote all their free time to refining their concert performances in detail.
Tomáš is the author of music and lyrics and his undeniable and at the same time
unattainable role models are Jaro Filip and Milan Lasica. Despite the fact that he is aware
that he will be the second best composer and lyricist in the history of Slovak popular music,
he accepted this fact with his own modesty and does not resist. Markéta is a singer who, in
addition to recitation of Tomáš songs, has been used in recent years as a so-called live
playback at Marie Rottrová&#39;s concerts, singing her songs backstage, while the legendary
singer concentrates on eye contact with the audience with the microphone turned off.</i>"
